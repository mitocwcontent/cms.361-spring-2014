1.  A post introducing yourself and your interest in the seminar.
2.  A book report,
3.  Your final project proposal,
4.  A revision of shared seminar notes;
5.  Your final project write-up.
6.  (6-8) The remaining 3 posts are open ended reflections.

Final Project
-------------

The final project is a written research paper (approx. 20â€“30 pages) focusing on some aspect of social movement media (tools, practices, production, circulation, reception, impacts, etc). Your project may focus on any social movement, or on multiple movements in comparative perspective, if you prefer. Your project must involve original research, although the research methods you employ are wide open. You'll analyze findings from your research within a framework drawn from social movement studies. The final project should include a short review of the literature you're drawing on, a discussion of your research question and methods, analysis of what you find, and a conclusion that discusses the implications.

### Example Project
